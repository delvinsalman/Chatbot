## ‚ú® **Enhanced Features**

### üé® **Generative AI Capabilities**
The chatbot utilizes a powerful, dual-model architecture to offer comprehensive AI functionality:
* **Text & Data Processing (Gemini 2.0 Flash):** Provides the core intelligence for natural conversation and sophisticated data analysis.
* **Image Generation (Hugging Face AI):** Generates high-quality, custom images directly within the chat using the **Stable Diffusion XL** model, powered by the **Hugging Face Inference API**.

### üß† **Advanced AI Configuration**
The core intelligence of the chatbot can be customized in the **Settings Panel**:
* **System Prompt:** Defines the AI's personality, role, or specific instructions for the entire conversation (e.g., "You are a professional Python programmer").
* **Temperature Control:** Adjusts the model's creativity and randomness using a slider (0.0 for deterministic, 1.0 for highly creative).

### üìÇ **Multi-Media & Document Analysis**
The bot is capable of processing and analyzing various file types, providing detailed insights and context-aware responses:
* **Image Analysis:** Supports uploading and analyzing images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`).
* **Document Analysis:** Supports uploading and analyzing text documents, including **PDFs, Word documents, and text files** (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`).

### üí¨ **Full Conversation Management**
A persistent sidebar allows for organized and continuous interaction:
* **Conversation History:** Automatically saves and loads previous chats across sessions.
* **New Chat:** Provides an easy way to start a fresh conversation.
* **Search & Clear:** Functions to search through conversation titles and clear all history.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Modern UI/UX**
The user interface is built for responsiveness and aesthetic appeal:
